In some situations, the population count is (seemingly) not correct.
This is because prompting e.g. "york" returns multiple places with the same name.
Apparently the Archidiocese of York is returned prior to the city of York. But has 0 population
Prompting a small blast radius (1km) exempts actual "York" from the search, so the population is 0.

A possible solution is to return the largest population number from the list of places (Though, new york could then be picked, which is wrong too). 
But ideally more accurate mapping of population numbers to latlong coordinates is needed.

A natural choice for more accurate mapping of population numbers to latlong coordinates could be achieved by using an image map. With population density stored in the pixels.

Currently wind speed and weather conditions are used to estimage the fallout casuality count.
A more accurate method could be using a model that calculates the spread of radiation based on the type of nuclear bomb and more advanced meteorological, geographical and topographical conditions.
* wind direction is not accounted for
* fallout zones other than a circle are not accounted for
* no account for differences in altitude of detonation, ground zero location.
* fallout over time

the escape time calculator tool should use a graph/ramp to (re)map the speed accordingly to the time it takes to: get up to speed, adjust to verticality components.

A survival chance function is not feasable and has been scrapped. This is because: the most straightforward way to implement this is to use a 'for each missile sent' to calculate the accumulated death toll.
The result of this is instead of returning the risk of being blown up, it risks blowing up the API and takes forever.
A suitable solution to this is to use a image-map to source population centers and create a selection of what pixels are hit, and calculate the death toll from there. Instead of reverse geolocating.
